# GitHub Actions Deployment Setup

## Current Status
The GitHub Actions workflow file exists locally but needs to be pushed to your GitHub repository.

## Required Files for GitHub Actions

### 1. Workflow File
Location: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
Status: ✅ Created locally, ❌ Not in GitHub repo

### 2. Configuration Files
- `netlify.toml` - ✅ Ready
- `package.json` - ✅ Updated with build scripts

## Next Steps

### Step 1: Verify Local Files
Run these commands in your local repository:

```bash
# Check if workflow file exists locally
ls -la .github/workflows/

# Should show: deploy.yml
```

### Step 2: Push to GitHub
```bash
# Add all files including the .github directory
git add .
git status
# Should show: .github/workflows/deploy.yml as a new file

# Commit and push
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment"
git push origin master
```

### Step 3: Verify on GitHub
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Browse files - you should see `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
3. Go to Actions tab - should show "Deploy to Netlify" workflow

### Step 4: Configure Secrets
In your GitHub repository settings:
1. Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Add these Repository secrets:
   - `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Netlify personal access token
   - `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`: Your Netlify site ID

## Troubleshooting

If the workflow file still doesn't appear:
1. Make sure you're pushing to the correct branch (`master` or `main`)
2. Check that the `.github` directory isn't in your `.gitignore`
3. Verify file permissions: `chmod 644 .github/workflows/deploy.yml`

## Test Deployment
After setup, any push to master will trigger automatic deployment to Netlify.
