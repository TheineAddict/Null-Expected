# Null:Expected - QA Thought Hub

A modern, professional blog and thought hub for QA professionals, built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Adding New Blog Posts

To add a new blog post to the website, simply create a new markdown file. The system automatically handles IDs, processing, and integration.

### 1. Create a New Markdown File

Create a new `.md` file in the `src/data/posts/` directory:

```
src/data/posts/your-post-title.md
```

### 2. Add Frontmatter and Content

Structure your markdown file with frontmatter at the top:

```typescript
---
title: "Your Blog Post Title"
excerpt: "A brief summary of your post that appears on the blog listing page."
category: "QA Processes"
author: "Jane Smith"
date: "2024-01-25"
readTime: "10 min read"
slug: "your-blog-post-url-slug"
---

# Your Blog Post Title

Your blog post content goes here in **Markdown format**.

## Section Headings
Use ## for main sections and ### for subsections.

- Use bullet points for lists
- Markdown is automatically converted to HTML
- No need to write HTML manually

> Use blockquotes for important quotes or callouts.

### Code Examples
```javascript
// Code blocks are supported with syntax highlighting
function example() {
  return "formatted code";
}
```
```

### 3. Content Formatting Guidelines

- **Markdown Format**: Write in standard Markdown (automatically converted to HTML)
- **Headings**: Use `##` for main sections, `###` for subsections
- **Paragraphs**: Regular text automatically becomes paragraphs
- **Lists**: Use `-` or `*` for bullet points, `1.` for numbered lists
- **Emphasis**: Use `**bold**` and `*italics*`
- **Code**: Use `` `inline code` `` and ``` for code blocks
- **Quotes**: Use `>` for blockquotes
- **Links**: Use `[text](url)` for links

### 4. Frontmatter Fields

- **title**: The post title (displayed as H1)
- **excerpt**: Brief summary for blog listing and SEO
- **category**: Choose from: 'QA Processes', 'Quality Mindset', 'Career Advice', 'Industry Trends', 'Tools & Tech', 'Case Studies'

- **date**: Publication date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- **readTime**: Estimated reading time (e.g., "10 min read")
- **slug**: URL-friendly version of the title

### 5. Slug Guidelines

Create URL-friendly slugs by:
- Converting to lowercase
- Replacing spaces with hyphens
- Removing special characters
- Keeping it descriptive but concise

Example: "The Art of Questioning: Why Curiosity Drives Quality" → "art-of-questioning-curiosity-drives-quality"

### 6. Category Guidelines

Choose the most appropriate category:
- **QA Processes**: Testing methodologies, frameworks, workflows
- **Quality Mindset**: Philosophy, thinking patterns, culture
- **Career Advice**: Professional growth, skills, transitions
- **Industry Trends**: New developments, future predictions
- **Tools & Tech**: Tool reviews, comparisons, tutorials
- **Case Studies**: Real-world examples, lessons learned, project stories

### 7. Read Time Estimation
