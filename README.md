## Adding New Blog Posts

To add a new blog post to the website, follow these steps:

### 1. Open the Blog Posts Data File

Navigate to `src/data/blogPosts.ts` - this file contains all blog post content and metadata.

### 2. Add Your New Post

Add a new blog post object to the `blogPosts` array. Here's the structure:

```typescript
{
  id: 7, // Increment from the last post ID
  title: 'Your Blog Post Title',
  excerpt: 'A brief summary of your post that appears on the blog listing page.',
  category: 'QA Processes', // Choose from: 'QA Processes', 'Quality Mindset', 'Career Advice', 'Industry Trends', 'Tools & Tech'
  readTime: '10 min read', // Estimate based on content length
  date: '2024-01-20', // Publication date in YYYY-MM-DD format
  slug: 'your-blog-post-url-slug', // URL-friendly version of the title
  author: 'Jane Smith', // Choose from: 'Jane Smith' or 'Alex Davis'
  content: `
    <p>Your blog post content goes here in HTML format.</p>
    
    <h2>Section Headings</h2>
    <p>Use h2 for main sections and h3 for subsections.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Use unordered lists for bullet points</li>
      <li>Use ordered lists for numbered steps</li>
    </ul>
    
    <blockquote>
      Use blockquotes for important quotes or callouts.
    </blockquote>
    
    <h3>Code Examples</h3>
    <pre><code>// Use pre and code tags for code blocks
    function example() {
      return "formatted code";
    }
    </code></pre>
  `
}
```

### 3. Content Formatting Guidelines

- **HTML Structure**: Use proper HTML tags for formatting
- **Headings**: Use `<h2>` for main sections, `<h3>` for subsections
- **Paragraphs**: Wrap text in `<p>` tags
- **Lists**: Use `<ul>` and `<ol>` with `<li>` items
- **Emphasis**: Use `<strong>` for bold, `<em>` for italics
- **Code**: Use `<code>` for inline code, `<pre><code>` for code blocks
- **Quotes**: Use `<blockquote>` for important callouts
- **Links**: Use `<a href="url">` for external links

### 4. Slug Guidelines

Create URL-friendly slugs by:
- Converting to lowercase
- Replacing spaces with hyphens
- Removing special characters
- Keeping it descriptive but concise

Example: "The Art of Questioning: Why Curiosity Drives Quality" → "art-of-questioning-curiosity-drives-quality"

### 5. Category Guidelines

Choose the most appropriate category:
- **QA Processes**: Testing methodologies, frameworks, workflows
- **Quality Mindset**: Philosophy, thinking patterns, culture
- **Career Advice**: Professional growth, skills, transitions
- **Industry Trends**: New developments, future predictions
- **Tools & Tech**: Tool reviews, comparisons, tutorials

### 6. Read Time Estimation

Estimate reading time based on content length:
- ~200 words per minute average reading speed
- 1,000 words ≈ 5 min read
- 2,000 words ≈ 10 min read
- 3,000 words ≈ 15 min read

### 7. Save and Test

After adding your post:
1. Save the `blogPosts.ts` file
2. The post will automatically appear on the blog page
3. Test the individual post page by navigating to `/blog/your-slug`
4. Verify formatting, links, and readability

### 8. Author Information

The system supports two authors:
- **Jane Smith**: Automation and technical focus
- **Alex Davis**: Process and strategy focus

Author bios and avatars are automatically populated based on the author field.

## Content Best Practices

- **Engaging Titles**: Make them specific and benefit-focused
- **Strong Openings**: Hook readers with the first paragraph
- **Scannable Content**: Use headings, lists, and short paragraphs
- **Actionable Insights**: Provide practical takeaways
- **Real Examples**: Include specific scenarios and case studies
- **Clear Structure**: Logical flow from introduction to conclusion

## Technical Notes

- Posts are stored as TypeScript objects for type safety
- Content is rendered with proper styling via Tailwind CSS
- The system automatically handles URL routing and SEO metadata
- All posts are statically generated for optimal performance
