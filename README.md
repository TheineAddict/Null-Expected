## ðŸš€ Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Adding New Blog Posts

### 1. Create a New Markdown File

Create a new `.md` file in the `src/data/posts/` directory:

```
src/data/posts/your-post-title.md
```

### ðŸš¨ Draft Posts Safety Feature

To prevent accidental publishing of unfinished posts:

**Draft Posts:** Name your file starting with `draft-` (e.g., `draft-my-new-post.md`)
- âœ… **Safe**: Draft posts are completely invisible on the website
- âœ… **Local Testing**: You can still test drafts locally with `npm run dev`
- âœ… **No Accidents**: Even if you push to GitHub, drafts won't appear live

**Publishing:** When ready to publish, rename the file to remove `draft-`
- `draft-my-new-post.md` â†’ `my-new-post.md`
- Push the renamed file to GitHub
- The post becomes live automatically

### **Featured Posts**
To make a post appear in the "Featured Insights" section on the homepage:
- Add `"featured"` to the tags array in frontmatter
- Example: `tags: ["featured", "automation", "strategy"]`
- Only posts tagged with "featured" will appear in this section

### 2. Add Frontmatter and Content

Structure your markdown file with frontmatter at the top:

```typescript
---
title: "Your Blog Post Title"
excerpt: "A brief summary of your post that appears on the blog listing page."
category: "QA Processes"
author: "Jane Smith"
date: "2024-01-25"
readTime: "10 min read"
slug: "your-blog-post-url-slug"
---
