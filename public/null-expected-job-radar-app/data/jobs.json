This is a unique opportunity to join as one of the early engineering team members of a well-funded startup building at the intersection of generative AI and cybersecurity. You'll design, code, and maintain sophisticated infrastructure spanning 12-15 AWS accounts, each with dedicated Kubernetes clusters, ensuring complete data segregation for our security-conscious enterprise customers.</p><p>You'll take full ownership of our infrastructure-as-code implementation, managing multiple Kubernetes clusters at scale using cutting-edge tools like Karpenter, Flux, and Kustomize. Your success will be measured by infrastructure reliability, deployment velocity, and your ability to build self-managed, distributed systems that scale elegantly as we grow from startup to enterprise scale. This role is perfect for a hands-on infrastructure engineer who has mastered complex Kubernetes deployments at scale, writes production-grade infrastructure code, and thrives on building simple, elegant solutions to complex distributed systems challenges.</p><p><strong>Your Contributions to Our Journey:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Architect Multi-Cluster Kubernetes Infrastructure:</strong> Design, implement, and write infrastructure-as-code for our complex Kubernetes setup spanning multiple AWS accounts, ensuring each cluster is completely isolated for enterprise security requirements while maintaining operational efficiency</p></li><li><p><strong>Build Self-Managed, Distributed Systems:</strong> Develop infrastructure that manages itself through GitOps workflows using Flux and Kustomize, creating distributed systems where actions in one place automatically trigger appropriate changes across the infrastructure without manual intervention</p></li><li><p><strong>Scale Kubernetes Operations:</strong> Manage and optimize dozens of Kubernetes clusters across our multi-tenant and single-tenant environments, implementing auto-scaling solutions with Karpenter and ensuring seamless scaling as customer workloads grow exponentially</p></li><li><p><strong>Develop Production-Grade Automation:</strong> Write robust, maintainable code to build and maintain CI/CD pipelines, custom automation tools, and deployment scripts that enable rapid feature delivery while maintaining the highest reliability standards</p></li><li><p><strong>Ensure Enterprise Security:</strong> Implement security best practices and compliance measures that protect our highly sensitive security data, managing firewalls, encryption, IAM policies, and network segregation across our multi-account AWS architecture</p></li><li><p><strong>Optimize Platform Performance:</strong> Build comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting systems that proactively identify issues, using tools like Prometheus and Grafana to ensure our infrastructure scales efficiently as we handle increasingly complex workloads</p></li><li><p><strong>Enable Engineering Velocity:</strong> Work closely with backend and data engineering teams to build self-service infrastructure capabilities, allowing teams to provision databases, deploy services, and scale resources independently without constant infrastructure team involvement</p></li></ul><p><strong>What You Need to Be Successful:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Kubernetes Mastery at Scale:</strong> 5+ years of infrastructure/DevOps experience with deep, hands-on expertise managing complex Kubernetes deployments—you must have experience with multiple Kubernetes clusters (tens of clusters) in sophisticated setups, not just simple single-cluster environments</p></li><li><p><strong>GitOps and Modern K8s Tooling:</strong> Proven production experience with Karpenter (for auto-scaling), Flux (for GitOps), and Kustomize (for configuration management)—if you have these three, you'll be a fish in the water with our infrastructure approach</p></li><li><p><strong>AWS Infrastructure Expertise:</strong> Deep knowledge of AWS with hands-on experience managing complex multi-account architectures, understanding how to design for isolation, security, and scalability across numerous AWS accounts with proper networking and IAM configuration</p></li><li><p><strong>Infrastructure-as-Code Excellence:</strong> Strong coding skills with production experience using Terraform or CloudFormation, writing maintainable, well-architected infrastructure code that follows best practices and scales with organizational growth. Proficiency in Python is essential for automation, tooling, and infrastructure development</p></li><li><p><strong>Hands-On Coding:</strong> Currently active as a developer writing production code in Python for infrastructure automation, custom tooling, and operational scripts—you're not just an architect who delegates implementation</p></li><li><p><strong>Simplicity-Driven Architecture:</strong> Proven ability to build simple, elegant solutions to complex infrastructure problems—you instinctively know the \"right way\" to use tools like Helm charts and avoid over-engineering while maintaining scalability</p></li><li><p><strong>Platform Thinking:</strong> Experience building infrastructure with a platform mindset, creating systems that support multiple products and enable team self-service rather than building one-off solutions for individual applications</p></li><li><p><strong>AWS Managed Services Philosophy:</strong> Understanding of when to use AWS managed services (RDS, MSK, EMR) versus building custom solutions, with experience scaling startups using managed services efficiently before investing in complex self-hosted infrastructure</p></li><li><p><strong>Distributed Systems Mindset:</strong> Deep understanding of distributed systems principles with experience building infrastructure that is decentralized rather than centralized, allowing independent operation across multiple clusters and regions</p></li><li><p><strong>Nice to haves:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Experience with AWS auto-scaling across complex, multi-cluster environments</p></li><li><p>Background in security-focused infrastructure or handling sensitive enterprise data</p></li><li><p>Previous experience at scale-ups that grew infrastructure from 20-100+ engineers</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of infrastructure observability tools beyond Prometheus/Grafana (e.g., ELK Stack)</p></li><li><p>Track record of building infrastructure that went through SOC2, ISO, or similar compliance certifications</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Why Join Us:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Ambitious Infrastructure Challenges:</strong> We're using generative AI (LLMs and agents) to solve critical cybersecurity challenges, requiring sophisticated infrastructure that handles sensitive security data across isolated enterprise environments. You'll build the foundation for breakthrough AI-powered security solutions at unprecedented scale.</p></li><li><p><strong>Expert Team:</strong> We are a team of hands-on leaders with deep experience in Big Tech and Scale-ups. Our team has been part of the leadership teams behind multiple acquisitions and an IPO.</p></li><li><p><strong>Impactful Work:</strong> Cybersecurity is a force for good—helping stop cyber attacks ultimately helps deliver better outcomes for all of us. The infrastructure you build will directly enable security teams to protect organizations worldwide from real threats.</p></li><li><p><strong>Build an AI-Native Company:</strong> We're building a new company in the AI era with the opportunity to design everything from the ground up—you'll architect infrastructure using cutting-edge Kubernetes practices and establish platform standards that will scale with us from startup through hypergrowth.</p></li><li><p><strong>Technical Leadership Growth:</strong> Direct partnership with experienced engineering leadership, significant equity upside, and the opportunity to own and shape the entire infrastructure function as we scale our platform to support the world's largest enterprises.</p></li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>To apply:</strong> <a href=\"https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/maze-infra-devops-engineer\">https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/maze-infra-devops-engineer</a></p>",

You’ll manage and scale them to provide a world-class experience for our members, both online and offline.</p>\n<p>You’ll work closely with our Founder/CEO, who geeks out on all things community.

Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>We are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--Is this a real job ad?--</p>\n<p>Yup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it’s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 70ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we’re big time, people.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>Our careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we’re a pretty big deal):</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\">http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/</a></p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>And check out our reviews on <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=JLS+Trading+Co%20Charlotte,%20NC\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-JLS-Trading-EI_IE1949817.11,22.htm\">Glassdoor</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Jls-Trading-Co\">Indeed</a> to see that it’s not just the founder’s mother who says we’re cool.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--What do you guys do?--</p>\n<p>We do a lot of different things these days including selling awesome consumer products (these are just a small sampling):</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>- Bad Parking Cards (<a href=\"https://amz.run/5Eya\">https://amz.run/5Eya</a>)</p>\n<p>- Beverage Barricades (<a href=\"https://amz.run/6kip\">https://amz.run/6kip</a>)</p>\n<p>- Child Chucker (<a href=\"https://amz.run/9EUz\">https://amz.run/9EUz</a>)</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>Running this Amazon Pay-Per-Click agency: PPCFarm.com (we’re really, really good at PPC)</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>And we will soon be launching a SaaS product for inventory management.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>We are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and it’s our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--What is your company like?--</p>\n<p>1. You Can Be Yourself. You don’t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged), and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>2. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn’t matter what your credentials are – it matters what you get done.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>3. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don’t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we’re happy campers.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>4. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you’re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you’re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>6. No Micro-Management. Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren’t the place for you.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>7. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could it really be? [Yes]</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>8. Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful – internal politics are at a minimum here.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>9. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>10. We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>11. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>12. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. We’ve even started letting people skip meetings during labor!</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>13. Self-Funded So We Can Do What’s Right for Us. We don’t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--What are your company’s values?--</p>\n<p>See here: <a href=\"http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\">http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/</a></p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>Yes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it’s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you’ll learn a lot about us.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--OK, so I’ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--</p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--Wait... What?--</p>\n<p>OK fine. Super short version:</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>Inventing remarkable consumer products - taking concepts from \"this should exist\" to \"holy shit, why didn't this exist before\" - in the kitchen and household space.</p>\n<p>Bulleted Responsibilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Take product concepts and figure out how to make them work elegantly</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Design products in CAD (we use SolidWorks, but we're flexible on software)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Prototype heavily in-house (3D printing, testing, breaking, improving, repeat)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Iterate relentlessly until the product hits our \"remarkable\" quality threshold</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Collaborate with our supply chain team on Design for Manufacturing and sourcing decisions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deliver production-ready CAD files and specifications for manufacturing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Solve hard problems that don't have obvious solutions (this is like 80% of the job)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To give you an idea of what we make: Beverage Barricades (the magnetic drink guard), CrocoDicer, and various kitchen gadgets that make people's lives meaningfully better. We're not making generic private label crap - we're inventing things that are genuinely novel and patentable.</p>\n<p>Fair warning: this is slow, deliberate work. A single product might take 6-36 months from concept to launch. We are quality-obsessed and refuse to ship mediocre products. If you need the dopamine hit of shipping something every week, you will be miserable here.</p>\n<p>Like everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>It is challenging, but fun work that’s going to require a lot of time and task management, problem-solving, and a reasonable amount of people skills.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--Do I need a college degree?--</p>\n<p>You just need to be awesome.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--Are there any geographic restrictions?--</p>\n<p>As long as you are in a country that doesn’t have active sanctions from the US government, we are interested. Our founder isn’t known for respecting the government much, but they have all the guns, so…</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--Do I need an engineering degree?--</p>\n<p>Nope. Our current product engineer is largely self-taught and didn't go to engineering school. We don't care about credentials - we care about whether you can actually invent great products. If you can demonstrate strong CAD skills and a track record of making things, that matters way more than a diploma.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--What CAD software do you use?--</p>\n<p>We currently use SolidWorks, but we're not religious about it. What matters is that you can produce production-ready 3D models. If you're proficient in Fusion 360, AutoCAD, or similar - that's fine. Just know that you'll need to come in with strong 3D modeling skills; we're not training from zero.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--How many products will I work on at once?--</p>\n<p>Typically 1-2 at a time. This is deep focus work, not juggling a dozen things. You'll spend months on a single product, iterating until it's genuinely great.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--What if I've never worked in consumer products before?--</p>\n<p>That's fine, as long as you have demonstrated ability to design and prototype physical products. Whether that came from industrial design, mechanical engineering, or just being a maker who builds stuff in your garage - we care about the skill, not the pedigree.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--Do I need to deal with manufacturers directly?--</p>\n<p>You'll collaborate with our supply chain team on Design for Manufacturing and be involved in sourcing decisions, but you won't own the vendor relationships. Supply chain handles the day-to-day communication with factories. Your job is to design products that can actually be manufactured.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--What does a typical day look like?--</p>\n<p>Variable as hell. Some days you're deep in CAD. Some days you're running prototype tests. Some days you're researching materials or competitor products. Very few meetings. Basically no bureaucracy. What's consistent is working independently, solving hard problems, and pushing toward \"remarkable.\"</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--6-36 months per product? Really?--</p>\n<p>Really. We iterate until it's genuinely great. We'd rather take 2 years to launch something remarkable than rush out something mediocre in 3 months.

Not because they're lazy, but because traditional apps optimize for streaks and gamification instead of actual conversation skills.</p>\n<p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">We're building something different: a language learning experience that gets people speaking from day one and keeps them coming back because they're actually having conversations, not just completing lessons.</p>\n<h2 class=\"text-text-100 mt-3 -mb-1 text-[1.125rem] font-bold\">The Opportunity</h2>\n<p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">You'll own the core product experience for Jumpspeak—the app that hundreds of thousands of learners use to gain real conversational confidence in new languages. This isn't about managing a team or attending strategy offsites. This is about shipping features that directly impact whether someone can order coffee in Paris or negotiate a deal in São Paulo.</p>\n<p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">You'll work directly with our CEO and small product team to shape what language learning should feel like.

Today, thanks to visual development platforms and AI, high-quality products can be built faster, cheaper, and mostly without writing code.</p>\n<p>Airdev is the world's first and largest agency that specializes in this approach, helping clients from early-stage startups to Fortune 500 enterprises turn their ideas into powerful, scalable software.</p>\n<h3><strong>About the role</strong></h3>\n<p>We're looking for a Technical Project Lead to own the delivery of complex software projects from kickoff through launch.</p>\n<p>You'll be the central point of coordination for each project you manage, working with our team members and clients to make sure requirements are clear, work is properly sequenced, and nothing slips through the cracks. You'll write detailed specifications, manage task breakdowns, run client meetings, and keep everyone aligned on progress and priorities.</p>\n<p>The applications we build often involve multiple user types, intricate business logic, and dozens of interconnected features. You'll need to understand how all the pieces fit together well enough to spot gaps in requirements, anticipate dependencies, and keep everything moving in the right order.</p>\n<p>You'll work closely with Product Directors (who own product strategy and architecture) and Account Directors (who own the client relationship), while you own the execution.</p>\n<p><strong>What you'll do</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Run projects from requirements through delivery, making sure work is completed on time and within scope</li>\n<li>Create and maintain detailed task lists, translating requirements into clear items for developers</li>\n<li>Write feature specifications that give developers what they need to build correctly</li>\n<li>Lead regular client calls to communicate progress, gather feedback, and align on priorities</li>\n<li>Coordinate across internal teams to keep projects moving and resolve blockers quickly</li>\n<li>Monitor project health and flag risks before they impact timelines</li>\n<li>Maintain clear documentation so project status and decisions are always visible</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Things we look for</strong></h3>\n<p>We value a mix of hard and soft skills, as well as alignment to our core values (https://www.airdev.co/core-values), in all of our people. Some specific qualities for this role include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3+ years of experience in technical project management, software QA, or a similar role working closely with development teams</li>\n<li>Solid understanding of software fundamentals: databases, APIs, data relationships, and application logic. You can read a detailed technical specification and fully grasp what's being described.</li>\n<li>Exceptional attention to detail and strong organizational instincts. You create systems to track work and follow through relentlessly.</li>\n<li>Clear, precise written communication. Your specs and documentation leave little room for misinterpretation.</li>\n<li>You identify issues early and address them before they escalate.</li>\n<li>Comfort managing complexity. You can keep track of many moving pieces and understand how they connect.</li>\n<li>Confidence in client-facing communication. You can lead a meeting, explain technical concepts in plain terms, and manage expectations well.</li>\n<li>Experience in an agency or consulting environment, or managing multiple concurrent projects, is a plus</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Why work at Airdev?</strong></h3>\n<p>At Airdev, you'll have full ownership of your work and see the direct impact of your contributions as we pioneer the future of software development. Here's what we provide to support your success:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remote flexibility: Work from anywhere with a reliable internet connection, with flexible scheduling around team needs</li>\n<li>Health benefits (US based employees): Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) for healthcare expenses</li>\n<li>Retirement savings(US based employees): 401k retirement plan with company matching</li>\n<li>Equipment  workspace: Get a one-time stipend for your home office setup, and monthly reimbursement for co-working spaces</li>\n<li>Learning  development: Annual education stipend for courses and professional development</li>\n<li>Flexible PTO policy: Take the time you need to recharge</li>\n<li>Paid family leave: Generous paid leave for new parents</li>\n<li>Milestone sabbatical: One-month paid sabbatical after four years with the company</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Diversity at Airdev</strong></h3>\n<p>We aim to make software development accessible to those for whom it wasn't a viable career path before. We value diversity in all parts of our organization, and encourage people from varied backgrounds to apply to work here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To apply:</strong> <a href=\"https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/airdev-technical-project-lead\">https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/airdev-technical-project-lead</a></p>",

We are the #1 registrar as ranked by our 100% real TrustPilot customer reviews. We have over 400,000 active customers and nearly 3,000,000 domains under management. But we're a small team, and that means a single, motivated individual can make a huge impact.</p>\n<p>Porkbun is committed to a policy of nondiscrimination in employment on any basis. This is a fun place to work, but we’re not blind optimists; instead, our culture thrives on clear-eyed assessments to recognize and solve problems. Also, everyone who works here is genuinely nice.

      "descriptionText": "- Do you see crappy products everywhere and think \"I could make that so much better\"?\n\n- Does your brain refuse to stop solving problems, even when you're supposed to be relaxing?\n\n- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?\n\nIf so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don’t put up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.\n\nWe are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.\n\n--Is this a real job ad?--\n\nYup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it’s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 70ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we’re big time, people.\n\nOur careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we’re a pretty big deal):\n\nhttp://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\nAnd check out our reviews on Google, Glassdoor, or Indeed to see that it’s not just the founder’s mother who says we’re cool.\n\n--What do you guys do?--\n\nWe do a lot of different things these days including selling awesome consumer products (these are just a small sampling): \n\n- Bad Parking Cards (https://amz.run/5Eya)\n\n- Beverage Barricades (https://amz.run/6kip)\n\n- Child Chucker (https://amz.run/9EUz)\n\nRunning this Amazon Pay-Per-Click agency: PPCFarm.com (we’re really, really good at PPC)\n\nAnd we will soon be launching a SaaS product for inventory management.\n\nWe are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and it’s our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.\n\n--What is your company like?--\n\n1. You Can Be Yourself. You don’t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged), and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you.\n\n2. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn’t matter what your credentials are – it matters what you get done.\n\n3. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don’t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we’re happy campers.\n\n4. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you’re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you’re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\n\n5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.\n\n6. No Micro-Management. Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren’t the place for you.\n\n7. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could it really be? [Yes]\n\n8. Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful – internal politics are at a minimum here.\n\n9. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.\n\n10. We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\n\n11. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.\n\n12. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. We’ve even started letting people skip meetings during labor!\n\n13. Self-Funded So We Can Do What’s Right for Us. We don’t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.\n\n--What are your company’s values?--\n\nSee here: http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\nYes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it’s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you’ll learn a lot about us.\n\n--OK, so I’ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--\n\nNo.\n\n--Wait... What?--\n\nOK fine. Super short version:\n\nInventing remarkable consumer products - taking concepts from \"this should exist\" to \"holy shit, why didn't this exist before\" - in the kitchen and household space.\n\nBulleted Responsibilities:\n\nTake product concepts and figure out how to make them work elegantly\n\nDesign products in CAD (we use SolidWorks, but we're flexible on software)\n\nPrototype heavily in-house (3D printing, testing, breaking, improving, repeat)\n\nIterate relentlessly until the product hits our \"remarkable\" quality threshold\n\nCollaborate with our supply chain team on Design for Manufacturing and sourcing decisions\n\nDeliver production-ready CAD files and specifications for manufacturing\n\nSolve hard problems that don't have obvious solutions (this is like 80% of the job)\n\nTo give you an idea of what we make: Beverage Barricades (the magnetic drink guard), CrocoDicer, and various kitchen gadgets that make people's lives meaningfully better. We're not making generic private label crap - we're inventing things that are genuinely novel and patentable.\n\nFair warning: this is slow, deliberate work. A single product might take 6-36 months from concept to launch. We are quality-obsessed and refuse to ship mediocre products. If you need the dopamine hit of shipping something every week, you will be miserable here.\n\nLike everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.\n\nIt is challenging, but fun work that’s going to require a lot of time and task management, problem-solving, and a reasonable amount of people skills.\n\n--Do I need a college degree?--\n\nYou just need to be awesome.\n\n--Are there any geographic restrictions?--\n\nAs long as you are in a country that doesn’t have active sanctions from the US government, we are interested. Our founder isn’t known for respecting the government much, but they have all the guns, so…\n\n--Do I need an engineering degree?--\n\nNope. Our current product engineer is largely self-taught and didn't go to engineering school. We don't care about credentials - we care about whether you can actually invent great products. If you can demonstrate strong CAD skills and a track record of making things, that matters way more than a diploma.\n\n--What CAD software do you use?--\n\nWe currently use SolidWorks, but we're not religious about it. What matters is that you can produce production-ready 3D models. If you're proficient in Fusion 360, AutoCAD, or similar - that's fine. Just know that you'll need to come in with strong 3D modeling skills; we're not training from zero.\n\n--How many products will I work on at once?--\n\nTypically 1-2 at a time. This is deep focus work, not juggling a dozen things. You'll spend months on a single product, iterating until it's genuinely great.\n\n--What if I've never worked in consumer products before?--\n\nThat's fine, as long as you have demonstrated ability to design and prototype physical products. Whether that came from industrial design, mechanical engineering, or just being a maker who builds stuff in your garage - we care about the skill, not the pedigree.\n\n--Do I need to deal with manufacturers directly?--\n\nYou'll collaborate with our supply chain team on Design for Manufacturing and be involved in sourcing decisions, but you won't own the vendor relationships. Supply chain handles the day-to-day communication with factories. Your job is to design products that can actually be manufactured.\n\n--What does a typical day look like?--\n\nVariable as hell. Some days you're deep in CAD. Some days you're running prototype tests. Some days you're researching materials or competitor products. Very few meetings. Basically no bureaucracy. What's consistent is working independently, solving hard problems, and pushing toward \"remarkable.\"\n\n--6-36 months per product? Really?--\n\nReally. We iterate until it's genuinely great. We'd rather take 2 years to launch something remarkable than rush out something mediocre in 3 months. If that timeline makes you anxious, this probably isn't the role for you.\n\n--What types of products will I be working on?--\n\nPrimarily kitchen and household products. Things that solve real problems people have. We're especially interested in products that can be patented and are hard for competitors to copy. Generally, we want to either radically improve a product in its category (like 200% better) or invent a new category.\n\n--This sounds pretty good, though I’m still skeptical that this isn’t a pyramid scheme.--\n\nYou sound just like the tax authorities!\n\n--That doesn’t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--\n\nPlease submit your information on the following page to apply. We promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.\n\nThere will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.\n\nOnce you’re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don’t want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you “yes” or “no”, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).\n\nThank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!",

We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $85+ million since.\n\nAs part of A·Team, you can expect:\n\nHigh-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies sent your way; generally $90-$150+/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, Pepsi, Walmart, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/Insight/Tiger/etc.\n\nWork alongside friends old & new: our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.\n\nFull autonomy: say \"no\" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. \n\nSmall, curated, off-the-record gatherings: for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.\n\nKeep 100% of what you earn: if you charge $120/hr, you get $120/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on top of your rate.\n\nHow to apply:\n\nGo here: https://build.a.team/remotivereferral + mention Remotive. We respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there’s a fit.\n\nWhat you’ll do:\n\nOnce part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests. Find the right pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would\n\nMissions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. \n\nYou’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. \n\nWho A·Team is for:\n\nSenior software developers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.\n\nThose who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role, who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.\n\nThe majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work), bootstrapping a side project, or looking for their next big thing\n\nWho A·Team is not for:\n\nPeople looking for small gigs\n\nFolks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites\n\nThose still early in their careers (<4 years) and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet)\n\nOur long-term vision:\n\nA·Team is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builder. We call them \"unhirables\": people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to, but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small, autonomous, distributed expert teams. \n\nTo help us secure amazing missions, we raised $60 million+  from Insight Partenrs, Tiger Global, NFX, RocNation, along with the former CEO of Upwork, the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade, Apple's Global Head of Recruiting, YC Partner Aaron Harris, Wharton's Adam Grant, and Duke's Dan Ariely.",

Your assistants visibly grow under your leadership—they're more confident, more skilled, and more engaged than when they started.\nYou protect the client experience.

You spot trends early, address small issues before they become big problems, and stay ahead of potential risks.\nYou communicate clearly and frequently. Your team always knows where they stand, what's expected, and how they're performing. Clients and leadership are kept informed without needing to chase you for updates.\nYou foster accountability. Your team members take ownership of their work because you've built a culture where performance matters and excellence is recognized.\nYou're a problem-solver, not a problem-identifier. When you bring issues to leadership, you also bring potential solutions and recommendations.\n\nWho This Role is NOT For:\nYou're looking for a \"management\" title without the daily coaching grind. This role is 80% coaching and 20% administration. If you don't genuinely enjoy developing people and giving regular feedback, this isn't the right fit.\nYou need highly structured processes with little ambiguity. While we have SOPs and frameworks, every client and assistant is different. You'll need to adapt your approach, make judgment calls, and navigate grey areas independently.\nYou avoid difficult conversations. Performance management means having tough discussions about underperformance, behavior issues, and sometimes making decisions about fit.\nYou wait to be told what to do. We need coaches who see problems and solve them, who identify opportunities and seize them, who take initiative without being prompted.\nYou're uncomfortable with data and metrics. This role is driven by numbers—CSAT scores, quality audits, productivity rates, and adherence.\nYou prefer to work alone rather than collaborate. You'll be coordinating with CSMs, Success Coaches, Training teams, Technical Support, and more.\nYou need constant validation or hand-holding. We provide support and guidance, but you're expected to work autonomously between weekly check-ins with your manager.\nYou resist feedback or believe you've \"figured it out.\" The best coaches are coachable themselves—open to feedback, willing to try new approaches, and committed to continuous learning.\nYou see this as a stepping stone, not a destination. While there's growth potential, we're looking for someone who genuinely wants to excel at coaching and team leadership, not someone just passing through to their \"real\" goal.\n\nQualified Candidate RequirementsExperience Requirements:\nSupervisory/Team Leadership Experience: Minimum 1 year of direct people management or team leadership experience, with proven ability to coach, develop, and hold team members accountable for performance (remote team management strongly preferred)\nBPO/Outsourcing/Customer Service/Virtual Assistant Background: At least 2 years in customer service, call center operations, BPO, or virtual assistant management roles—you understand the rhythm and challenges of client-facing remote work\nPerformance Management Experience: Demonstrated experience managing KPIs, conducting performance reviews, implementing improvement plans, and driving measurable performance improvements across a team\nAccount Management or Client Services: Experience managing client relationships, addressing escalations, and ensuring client satisfaction in a service delivery environment\nQuality Assurance Background: Familiarity with QA processes, call/ticket monitoring, scoring rubrics, and providing coaching based on quality audits\n\nTechnical Requirements:\nMetrics & Analytics Proficiency: Strong understanding of key performance indicators (CSAT, NPS, AHT, FCR, quality scores, adherence, productivity rates) and ability to analyze data to drive decisions\nCRM & Productivity Tools: Comfortable working with CRM systems (e.g., HubSpot, Salesforce, Zendesk), project management tools (Monday.com, Asana, ClickUp), communication platforms (Slack, Microsoft Teams), and call center technologies\nReporting & Documentation Skills: Ability to create clear performance reports, document coaching sessions, maintain team records, and communicate insights to leadership effectively\nTech Savvy: Quick to learn new software platforms and digital tools; comfortable troubleshooting basic technical issues and guiding team members through system challenges\nAI & Automation Comfortable: Open to leveraging AI tools for performance tracking, quality monitoring, and productivity enhancement (we'll provide training on specific tools)\n\nSkills & Competencies:\nCoaching Excellence: You know how to give feedback that motivates rather than discourages.

      "descriptionText": "About the Water Foundation The Water Foundation is a nonprofit philanthropy working to support lasting water solutions for communities, economies, and the environment. The Foundation complements strategic grantmaking with creative field-building and engagement with high-level decision makers and community leaders and helps funders identify and act on opportunities to better manage water. \n\nThe Water Foundation works in key watersheds across the West, as well as on federal policy, recognizing that water crosses political boundaries and natural places face similar challenges across the country. As a singularly focused water funder, the Water Foundation serves the entire water field, deploying staff expertise to move resources to the groups that can most effectively improve water systems that affect people and nature. The Water Foundation’s partners span a broad spectrum: conservation organizations, environmental justice groups, agricultural associations, water providers, business groups, and local, tribal, state, and federal agencies. \n\nIn 2024, the Water Foundation launched our ambitious strategic framework to guide the efforts and impact of the organization in the coming years. This strategy, which reflects extensive field input from partners and stakeholders, identifies the Foundation’s approach to catalyzing and advancing lasting water solutions at the local, state, and federal levels. The Foundation prioritizes securing safe, equitable, clean, and accessible water for people, restoring and sustaining freshwater ecosystems, and building climate resilient communities and watersheds. These three goals are critical to the future of water. In pursuing these goals, the Foundation supports the field in tackling immediate water problems, including polluted drinking water and collapsing ecosystems, in ways that alter system drivers, such as social inequality and outmoded infrastructure. We also work to mobilize new resources for water by convening the philanthropic community. In 2022, we expanded such efforts when the Water Table funder collaborative joined forces with the Foundation. This integration offers the opportunity to channel additional resources toward sustainable and equitable water solutions. \n\nInequity and injustice underlie many of the challenges the Water Foundation is working to address, such as the failure to provide clean, safe, and affordable drinking water or access to free-flowing rivers and green space to all communities. The Water Foundation has engaged in a learning initiative to ensure that the principles of diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice are embedded and embodied in their individual behavior, institutional operations, and strategic programming.

Deepen connections across and between water sector networks and related issues like climate, health, nature, food, and equity. \nHumility: Recognize and center the knowledge, experiences, and leadership of our partners and the communities we serve, while honoring the power of nature. Listen to and learn from our partners and nature, so that we support a community-led and nature-based vision for a resilient water future. \nSustainability: Advance resilient, intergenerational solutions that sustain the environment and those who depend upon it while honoring the intrinsic value of nature and strengthening organizations and communities that seek an equitable, alternative vision for the future.\nTransformation: Shape our strategies, work, and practices for systemic change towards a collaborative, just, and sustainable water future in the US. \nJustice: Align our policies, practices, and resources so that all people and ecosystems have genuine opportunities to thrive. \nMore information about the Water Foundation can be found at www.waterfdn.org.\n\nIn 2025, the Water Foundation launched an affiliated 501(c)(4), the Water Action Fund (www.wateractionfund.org) with a mission to ensure access to essential water resources for people and nature by supporting the advancement of local, state, and federal policies that promote public well-being and help U.S. communities prepare for various crises, including natural disasters and other emergencies.\n\nThe OpportunityThe Water Foundation seeks a Grants and Contracts Manager (Manager) to ensure the effective operations, compliance, and administrative aspects of the Water Foundation’s and Water Action Fund’s outgoing grants and contracts.
