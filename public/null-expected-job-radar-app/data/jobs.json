We make B2B technology companies most-recommended by AI (ChatGPT and Google). Our 20-person remote team combines ambition with real results.</p>\n<p><strong>This is a dream job for someone.</strong>Learning quickly, startups/technology, and thinking from first principles should all appeal to you.Our aim with this Job Description is to make it clear what we need. If this is your dream job, please get in touch.</p>\n<p><strong>You’ll be working directly with Ellipsis’ founder on sales</strong>, get a front-row seat to cutting-edge implementation of genAI in knowledge work, and learn incredibly quickly.</p>\n<p>We want to hire someone excited to learn and develop quickly. You’ll master B2B sales and cutting-edge AI SEO strategy and get a fast track into commercial strategy.</p>\n<h3>Trusted advisor</h3>\n<p>At Ellipsis, we succeed by being trusted advisors to our clients. Your role requires both strategic insight and execution excellence. You'll transform complex information into client opportunities, then fully own the implementation process.</p>\n<p>The SEO industry has its share of disappointing firms. Our clients value our honesty, integrity, and expertise. You won't earn their trust through aggressive selling – you'll earn it by genuinely understanding their business challenges and delivering results.</p>\n<h3>AI-native workflows but anti-slop</h3>\n<p>Ellipsis is not a normal agency. We built our FALCON AI 18-months pre-ChatGPT and have an AI native workflow (including a ton of cutting-edge tools we've built in-house) BUT 7 our 20 team members are Content Writers, because we hate slop, value quality, and value actually creating value for our clients.</p>\n<p>Everything we do is strategic. Our sales process is really having a strategy conversation with the prospect. You'll learn how all of this works, how to do your own research (backed by our Strategy team and world-class in-house AI tech), and how to package this in a way that's actually compelling.</p>\n<h3>We were first to AI search and you'll help drive our growth</h3>\n<p>Ellipsis’ success rests on 3 pillars:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Technology</strong>: FALCON AI is our in-house keyword selection product that uses machine learning to predict the ranking for SEO Content. FALCON AI is in-house, patent-pending technology we’ve built to solve the “hit and miss” problem with SEO. FALCON AI was featured in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/15/technology/ai-no-code.html\">The New York Times</a> 9 months before ChatGPT’s release – we were VERY early on AI – and now serves as our competitive advantage.</li>\n<li><strong>Expertise</strong>: We get proven results from an experienced in-house team. We do everything from the AISEO / SEO strategy, to the content production, to the writing, to beautiful graphics, in-house.</li>\n<li><strong>Process</strong>: Our clients get quality content they can count on, on time, every time. We produce a very high volume of content each month, and make sure each piece is perfect. We take quality really seriously.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>AI has rewritten the SEO rulebook, but we had already adapted.</strong>SEO is changing! Google’s AI Overviews are redirecting clicks! Agencies are tracking metrics that no longer matter! While they scramble to catch up – we’ve already solved these problems, and we’re taking more and more market share. We’re excited to find the right person to help us move forwards.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Requirements</h2>\n<div>\n<h3>Responsibilities to grow into</h3>\n<p>You'll start with parts of the process and develop as quickly as possible:</p>\n<p>You'll start here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chase deals through email and LinkedIn - follow-ups, nudges, re-engagement</li>\n<li>Keep the CRM accurate and flag what needs attention</li>\n<li>Prep for sales calls (0-4 per week): pull research from our AI tools, draft slides, build the story</li>\n<li>Write and send proposals</li>\n<li>Weekly sync with Ops on pipeline progress</li>\n<li>Attend conferences and events monthly (mainly London, occasionally abroad)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You'll grow into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Joining sales calls, then leading them</li>\n<li>Drafting strategy decks independently</li>\n<li>Shaping how we position and win work</li>\n<li>Understanding client gaps and assessing fit</li>\n<li>Talking with confidence about how we solve specific problems</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How fast you progress depends on you. We’ll provide you with the support and you can grow as fast as possible.</p>\n<h3>What makes this different</h3>\n<p>You'll sit next to the founder on live deals. You'll see how we win, how we lose, and why. Most roles promise \"exposure to leadership\" - this one means constant comms, live feedback, and real decisions.</p>\n<p>We're hiring for learning speed, not experience. If you're sharp, curious, and slightly impatient with where you are now, this is built for you.</p>\n<p>Note, don't confuse our bullishness about the future of Ellipsis with \"hustle culture\" etc. Our rejection of AI slop, 4 day week once-a-month, a talk of first principles should tell you a lot: we care about doing great work, about having impact, and we don't do things because<em>that's how they've always been done</em>. We are very proud of our collaborative culture that pairs continuous improvement with doing the best work of our careers.</p>\n<p><strong>We'd like to see 2-4 years of startup, biz dev, or agency experience</strong>but are more interested in how your experience - whatever it is - is relevant to the role and why you're a great fit for it, than any formal experience.</p>\n<p>This role requires travel ~once a month mainly to London (conferences/events) and Oxford (visit our Founder for meetings), with travel in Europe and the US in future.</p>\n<h3>About Ellipsis</h3>\n<p>20-person agency helping B2B tech companies get recommended by AI - ChatGPT and Google. We built FALCON AI 18 months before ChatGPT launched. Our clients are B2B technology leaders, from YC-backed startups to enterprises.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Benefits</h2>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>£36-42k salary plus pension</li>\n<li>This is a full-time, 100% remote role. Work from home, or the beach!</li>\n<ul>\n<li>We have a lot of clients in the US and California, so you’ll need to be available for client and new business calls in the 5-7pm UK slot a couple of days a week (generally don’t go later than this, but you’ll need to be available as needed).</li>\n</ul>\n<li>28 days of paid holiday</li>\n<ul>\n<li>An additional 1 paid holiday day a year with each year of tenure, up to a maximum of 5 additional days</li>\n</ul>\n<li>4-day work week, once a month</li>\n<li>Genuinely <a href=\"https://ellipsis.wiki/knowledge-base/core-collaboration-hours/\">flexible working</a>, although noting the meeting schedule requirements above</li>\n<li>Regular team retreats; last was Istanbul, previously in Edinburgh, Oxford, Madrid, and Budapest</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ellipsis.wiki/knowledge-base/maternity-paternity-leave-summary/\">Encanced maternity/ paternity</a>, and<a href=\"https://ellipsis.wiki/knowledge-base/sick-leave-summary/\"> sick pay</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is a pivotal role driving Ellipsis's next phase of growth. We need someone who can both spot opportunities and drive them through to completion, combining strategic thinking with hands-on execution.</p>\n<h3>The application process</h3>\n<p>It’s important we find the best candidate for this position, and our selection process will reflect this.</p>\n<p>Much of our company Wiki is externally accessible, and you’re encouraged to read through this before applying. <a href=\"https://ellipsis.wiki/knowledge-base/interview-and-hiring-process/\">We have a very useful guide to our interview process available here</a>. This tells you what we’re looking for and reading this will significantly increase your chance of success!</p>\n<p>We’ll review applications on a rolling basis but interviews start after the closing date. There’s thus no benefit to rushing to apply: we will bias heavily towards your application’s answers rather than your CV, and we’d love for you to take your time.</p>\n<p>We’re fortunate to receive a large volume of applications. You can make your application stand out by paying special attention to the main responsibilities of this role, and “how to apply”. If you think you’re a fit, or could be a fit – go for it!</p>\n<p>We use video calls for interviews. You’ll have video interviews using Google Meet, including with members of the Leadership team and the Founder.</p>\n<p>We understand that this is as much you interviewing us, as the other way round. Throughout the interview process, we’re extremely happy to answer your questions about the business, working here, and the future of the company.</p>\n<p>The final stage of our hiring process is a paid test project, which will be similar to work you could expect to do if you were hired. We’ll give you a week to complete the project, and expect it to be 4-6 hours of work.</p>\n<p>Following the completion of trial projects, we’ll ask for professional references from your previous 2 managers. We ask candidates to introduce us to their references, for a 10 minute call.</p>\n<p>We do great work for clients and are building an ethical business that lets everyone do their best work. If you think you could be the next person to join our team, please apply :)</p>\n<h3>How to apply</h3>\n<p>Please apply through Workable: <a href=\"https://apply.workable.com/getellipsis/\">https://apply.workable.com/getellipsis/</a>. We will decide who progresses to the next stage based on the form you submit, and your CV. Please give us a good reason to select you! Taking the time to research the role, <a href=\"https://ellipsis.wiki/knowledge-base/interview-and-hiring-process/\">what we're looking for</a>, what we do, and what you can do for us will increase your chance of success. Your cover letter is where you have the space to do this.</p>\n<p>Ellipsis is an equal opportunity workplace and is committed to equal employment opportunity.</p>\n<p>Whilst we love technology and sit at the leading edge of its adoption (we automate hundreds of thousands of actions a month internally), we want to hear from you rather than from ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>We will be screening applications for AI-generated content and will automatically disqualify AI-generated applications. Roughly a third of applications either don’t read or ignore this point; please don’t ignore it! And thank you in advance!</p>\n<p>The deadline for submission is the end of the day, on 20th February 2026.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"styles--2z_5t\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p><strong>To apply:</strong> <a href=\"https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/ellipsis-founder-s-associate-biz-dev-uk-based-remote-36-42k\">https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/ellipsis-founder-s-associate-biz-dev-uk-based-remote-36-42k</a></p>",

Review past experiments and their outcomes. Present your observations and opportunity areas to the team.</p></li><li><p><strong>First Six Months:</strong> Own and evolve your product-led growth roadmap with at least 3-5 shipped experiments. Lead hypothesis-driven tests that reduce friction in key workflows. Partner with Data to establish clear success metrics and translate insights into product decisions.

It’s now time for us to introduce a Head of Community role.</p>\n<p>We've been super focused on other parts of our membership for the last ~18 months and haven't focused as much as we used to on our Community and it's showing with a slow decline in our Community Engagement Metrics.</p>\n<p><strong>This is where we need your help </strong></p>\n<p>We’re looking for someone to take the reins of our community and lead strategies that connect  delight members and increase retention.</p>\n<p>Your role is to take full ownership of our community initiatives. You’ll manage and scale them to provide a world-class experience for our members, both online and offline.</p>\n<p>You’ll work closely with our Founder/CEO, who geeks out on all things community. Together, you’ll brainstorm ideas; then, you’ll take the reins to build them out. Reporting directly to the CEO, you’ll shape programs that inspire, connect, and delight our global Tribe.</p>\n<p>Community is our everything, so we're more than happy to back your ideas with a dedicated budget. We also believe in continuous learning, so we’ll cover the cost of courses, books, and resources to keep your skills sharp.</p>\n<p>In this role, you’ll see the real-world impact of your work: helping MSPs grow their businesses and improve their livelihoods.</p>\n<p>If this sounds like your kind of thing, we’d love to hear from you </p>\n<p><strong> ABOUT YOU</strong></p>\n<p>You're a people lover and community geek with a deep desire to serve at the highest level, operate with excellence and integrity, and grow every day.</p>\n<p>You'll thrive if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have a proven history of leading Communities (ideally B2B)</li>\n<li>You've previously built and led Community Teams</li>\n<li>You're comfortable working in a Text Based Community</li>\n<li>You're comfortable showing up on Camera and In-Person</li>\n<li>You care deeply about people and connection, and you understand why Community matters.</li>\n<li>You're happy working in a fully remote environment</li>\n<li>You have at least two hours of workday overlap with Sydney business hours (currently GMT+11). Bonus points if you’re in Australia or NZ!</li>\n<li>And... extra bonus points if you're already in the MSP or Tech industry.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE</strong></p>\n<p>Success in this role is when our Community Members are engaging and thriving in our Communities, both online <em>and</em>in-person.</p>\n<p>We have a number of different metrics we track to help quantitatively see how our Community is doing and we'll co-create some new metrics to help support us all in making great decisions.</p>\n<p>In saying that, there's also an underlying feeling that a Community has when it's humming and your role is to \"grow the hum\" </p>\n<p><strong> WHAT YOU'LL BE WORKING ON</strong></p>\n<p>We’re looking for you to strategize, lead and own the following areas (both in-person and virtually):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our Community Forum - grow our engagement metrics by building a culture of support, camaraderie  Community </li>\n<li>Our Networking Initiatives to help members build deeper relationships with each other</li>\n<li>Our Community Events Initiatives both Virtually  In-Person</li>\n<li>Our Member Results Programs to help our members make progress on their big challenges and goals</li>\n<li>Our Onboarding Initiatives to welcome new Members, help them get connected and go quickly from<em>Newbie</em>to<em>Superfan</em>.</li>\n<li>Our Support Initiatives to ensure members get fast, quality answers to their questions (our Support team helps here)</li>\n<li>An Awards and Recognition Program to reward and incentivise members and help them grow in Community status</li>\n<li>Our Industry Influencers program where we bring in subject matter experts to help our members both in our Community and in Virtual and In-Person Events.</li>\n<li>Our Moderation Program to ensure moderation is handled respectfully, professionally and quickly, including owning our moderation guidelines and leading our moderation team</li>\n<li>Our Vendor Initiatives to help members get better access to vendors that help  serve MSPs</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>You’ll also need to </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be a highly active voice inside our community, by initiating and facilitating community discussions and supporting members wherever possible.</li>\n<li>Build a regular survey program and member advisory panel to gather intel on how we can serve members even better, turning the results into outcomes.</li>\n<li>Track and Improve the KPIs that show our community’s health and business impact, reporting on them regularly and taking action as needed.</li>\n<li>Build, lead and manage your Team (including quarterly 1:1’s with any direct reports)</li>\n<li>Be equally as comfortable operating as an Individual Contributor (IC) as well as a Team Leader. The role will start out as primarily IC and gradually require more and more Team Leader / Management work as the team grows.</li>\n<li>Set Team Annual, Quarterly and Monthly Targets and Goals for your Team</li>\n<li>Report Weekly on you and your team's wins  outputs for the week, any lessons learnt from the week and the objectives for the next week (will be a simple 5-10 min. process)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, you’ll be responsible for setting and presenting the vision, strategy, budget, and hiring plan for our Community Team over the next few years. You’ll then refresh this annually.</p>\n<p>(<em>to give you time to learn the business, you won't need to do this until after your first three months</em>)</p>\n<p>You’ll have constant support from the CEO to set you up for wild success—working closely together early on, then tapering off as you settle into the role.</p>\n<p><strong>❌ WHO THIS ROLE IS NOT FOR?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you're looking for a hyper-growth Start-up Culture, we're not the place for you. We've never raised any outside capital and at ~9 years old our team is currently around 10 people. Instead of hyper-growth, we chose to adopt a sustainable, less stress path</li>\n<li>If you prefer working in a Physical Office with your colleagues beside you, then we're not the place for you. We're 100% Remote (although as we build our leadership team, we will meet up in person from time to time).</li>\n<li>If you prefer working in a large business where you only need to focus on your lane, then we’re not the place for you. Since we’re a small  nimble team, we often need to help each other out from time to time in the greater service to our members.</li>\n<li>If you have an unhealthy ego, we’re not the place for you. We have a culture of trust, transparency, and safety where we support each other to execute in our own zone of genius, try new things, make some mistakes, learn some lessons, grow ourselves, have fun and continually feel proud of what we achieve.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong> WHY JOIN US?</strong></p>\n<p>We're a bootstrapped, profitable and stable company that believes in empowering our team with whatever it takes so they can take ownership  excel in their role.</p>\n<p>We're committed to doing anything we can to help our clients (<em>we call them members</em>) succeed and you'll have a very important part to play in this journey </p>\n<p>You can see what our Team says about working for The Tech Tribe on our Glassdoor Profile here.</p>\n<p>You can see what our members say about us on our Wall of Love Page here </p>\n<p>Here's some other fun facts:</p>\n<p> We've grown nearly every single month since January 2017<br> We grow mostly by \"Word of Mouth\" Referrals<br> We have ~4,000+ MSPs as Paying Members<br> We've created 100's of Templates, Checklists, Marketing Campaigns and Workshops<br>✅ We have a Culture of SOPs and Documentation to help us deliver excellence<br>‍♂️ We work daily in ClickUp for Project and Task Management<br> We have Team Members in Australia, UK, Canada, USA, Romania, Venezuela and the Philippines<br> We're financially very stable, so job security is extremely high</p>\n<p><strong>✅ THE PERKS  PROMISES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You'll receive a Company Laptop  Accessories</li>\n<li>You'll have flexible Work-Hours (we focus more on outcomes)</li>\n<li>You'll have 20 days of Annual Leave</li>\n<li>You'll have 12 days of leave for National Holidays</li>\n<li>You'll have access to lots of Continual Education</li>\n<li>You'll never work on your Birthday </li>\n<li>You'll be paid generously</li>\n<li>You'll work in a supportive environment - we leave our egos at the door and focus on world-class work</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong> APPLY TODAY</strong></p>\n<p>Interested in joining our team?</p>\n<p><strong>Awesome - we'd love to hear from you.</strong></p>\n<p>The first step is to share a few basic details of <em>who you are</em>and<em>what you've created in the past</em>.</p>\n<p>If we think you'll be a great fit, we'll then ask some deeper questions to work out whether we'll be a good values fit.</p>\n<p>Let's get started </p>\n\n<p><strong>To apply:</strong> <a href=\"https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/the-tech-tribe-head-of-community\">https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/the-tech-tribe-head-of-community</a></p>",

As part of that journey, we’re expanding our focus on retention within our VSMB and SMB customer segments, and are committed to building systems that deliver value at scale without sacrificing the personal experience.</p>\n<p>This role leads that charge.

A Quick Note.</strong></p>\n<p>We know that tools like ChatGPT are part of how many of us work today (us too!). Feel free to use AI to support your writing, but don’t let it do the talking for you.

Right now, planning is fragmented—teams juggle issues, epics, and tickets while struggling to connect their daily work to business outcomes. You'll solve this by building flexible, configurable planning fundamentals that replace outdated agile mechanisms with intelligent automation. Your focus will be on evolving our work item model, integrating agentic AI functionality that handles repetitive planning tasks, and freeing up teams to focus on what matters: strategy, intent, and delivery. You'll report to a Group Manager of Product, working closely with product design and engineering leadership to define planning for a modern, AI-powered world. In your first year, you'll reshape the core planning experience that millions of developers across 100,000+ GitLab customers will rely on—transforming how teams think about planning, not as a burden, but as an intelligent partner in their success.</p>\n<h2><strong>What you’ll do</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Lead the Core Planning team's vision and strategy, guiding GitLab's shift from traditional agile planning mechanics toward enterprise-ready planning fundamentals that empower teams to organize, coordinate, and execute work more effectively</li>\n<li>Own the product strategy for work items—simplifying the fragmented landscape of issues, epics, and tickets into a configurable, unified primitive that scales across organizations of any size</li>\n<li>Drive the integration of agentic AI functionalities into planning workflows, replacing manual planning tasks with intelligent automation while ensuring trustworthiness and reliability for end users</li>\n<li>Collaborate cross-functionally with engineering, design, and product teams to understand developer and engineering manager needs, translating them into products that improve team coordination and workflow</li>\n<li>Define how planning connects to business outcomes, helping teams understand the ROI of their work and make data-driven capacity and cycle-time decisions</li>\n<li>Co-shape the product's approach to managing context and knowledge, ensuring critical business information and specifications flow seamlessly through the development lifecycle</li>\n<li>Partner with the Knowledge  Context and Project Management teams within Plan stage to balance responsibilities and eliminate redundancy as the planning experience evolves in the SDLC</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>What you’ll bring</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Experience building or shipping products for SaaS, DevOps, or DevSecOps platforms, or working in scale-ups in adjacent spaces</li>\n<li>Working knowledge of software development and familiarity with how development teams organize and coordinate their work</li>\n<li>Demonstrated ability to collaborate closely with engineering teams and use data and metrics to inform product decisions</li>\n<li>Comfort learning quickly in new domains and adapting your approach and decision making based on new information, rather than relying primarily on past patterns</li>\n<li>Track record of picking things up efficiently and getting productive in new product areas or organizations without extended onboarding periods</li>\n<li>A mindset that values fresh perspectives and questioning existing approaches, even if you've worked in related spaces before</li>\n<li>Experience working in distributed or remote environments, or collaborating with teams across different regions and time zones with excellent verbal and written communication skills.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>About the team</strong></h2>\n<p>The Plan stage is reimagining how development teams organize, coordinate, and execute their work. The Core Planning team you'll lead is at the heart of this transformation, owning the foundational workflows and mechanics that enable teams to plan effectively at scale. Working closely with engineering partners and product designers, your team is responsible for simplifying how work items (issues, epics, and tickets) are configured and coordinated, while simultaneously building trustworthy AI-powered agentic functionalities that free humans from repetitive planning tasks so they can focus on strategy and intent. You'll be tackling some of the most interesting challenges in DevOps: moving teams beyond traditional agile estimation guessing games toward real data-driven capacity planning, connecting business outcomes to actual team velocity, and scaling planning workflows across organizations with hundreds of developers. The team operates asynchronously across distributed regions and collaborates closely with engineering (led by your EM counterpart), design, and the broader Plan stage initiatives focused on knowledge management and intelligent automation. This is an opportunity to shape how millions of developers work together, replacing manual, repetitive planning mechanics with intelligent systems that amplify human decision-making.</p>\n<div class=\"c-message_actions__container c-message__actions\"></div>\n<div>Remote-Global</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h4><strong>How GitLab will support you</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/\">Benefits to support your health, finances, and well-being</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/paid-time-off/\">Flexible Paid Time Off</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/inclusion/erg-guide/#:~:text=Definition%20of%20the%20TMRG%20%2D%20Team%20Member%20Resource%20Groups,-TMRGs%20are%20voluntarytext=The%20purpose%20for%20this%20type,developing%20the%20sense%20of%20belonging.\">Team Member Resource Groups</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/stock-options/\">Equity Compensation  Employee Stock Purchase Plan</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/growth-and-development/\">Growth and Development Fund</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#parental-leave\">Parental leave</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/expenses/#equipment\">Home office</a>support</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note that we welcome interest from candidates with varying levels of experience; many successful candidates do not meet every single requirement.

Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>We are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--Is this a real job ad?--</p>\n<p>Yup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it’s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 70ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we’re big time, people.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>Our careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we’re a pretty big deal):</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\">http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/</a></p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>And check out our reviews on <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=JLS+Trading+Co%20Charlotte,%20NC\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-JLS-Trading-EI_IE1949817.11,22.htm\">Glassdoor</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Jls-Trading-Co\">Indeed</a> to see that it’s not just the founder’s mother who says we’re cool.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--What do you guys do?--</p>\n<p>We do a lot of different things these days including selling awesome consumer products (these are just a small sampling):</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>- Bad Parking Cards (<a href=\"https://amz.run/5Eya\">https://amz.run/5Eya</a>)</p>\n<p>- Beverage Barricades (<a href=\"https://amz.run/6kip\">https://amz.run/6kip</a>)</p>\n<p>- Child Chucker (<a href=\"https://amz.run/9EUz\">https://amz.run/9EUz</a>)</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>Running this Amazon Pay-Per-Click agency: PPCFarm.com (we’re really, really good at PPC)</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>And we will soon be launching a SaaS product for inventory management.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>We are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and it’s our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--What is your company like?--</p>\n<p>1. You Can Be Yourself. You don’t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged), and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>2. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn’t matter what your credentials are – it matters what you get done.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>3. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don’t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we’re happy campers.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>4. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you’re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you’re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>6. No Micro-Management. Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren’t the place for you.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>7. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could it really be? [Yes]</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>8. Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful – internal politics are at a minimum here.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>9. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>10. We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>11. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>12. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. We’ve even started letting people skip meetings during labor!</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>13. Self-Funded So We Can Do What’s Right for Us. We don’t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--What are your company’s values?--</p>\n<p>See here: <a href=\"http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\">http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/</a></p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>Yes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it’s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you’ll learn a lot about us.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--OK, so I’ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--</p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--Wait... What?--</p>\n<p>OK fine. Super short version:</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>Inventing remarkable consumer products - taking concepts from \"this should exist\" to \"holy shit, why didn't this exist before\" - in the kitchen and household space.</p>\n<p>Bulleted Responsibilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Take product concepts and figure out how to make them work elegantly</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Design products in CAD (we use SolidWorks, but we're flexible on software)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Prototype heavily in-house (3D printing, testing, breaking, improving, repeat)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Iterate relentlessly until the product hits our \"remarkable\" quality threshold</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Collaborate with our supply chain team on Design for Manufacturing and sourcing decisions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deliver production-ready CAD files and specifications for manufacturing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Solve hard problems that don't have obvious solutions (this is like 80% of the job)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To give you an idea of what we make: Beverage Barricades (the magnetic drink guard), CrocoDicer, and various kitchen gadgets that make people's lives meaningfully better. We're not making generic private label crap - we're inventing things that are genuinely novel and patentable.</p>\n<p>Fair warning: this is slow, deliberate work. A single product might take 6-36 months from concept to launch. We are quality-obsessed and refuse to ship mediocre products. If you need the dopamine hit of shipping something every week, you will be miserable here.</p>\n<p>Like everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>It is challenging, but fun work that’s going to require a lot of time and task management, problem-solving, and a reasonable amount of people skills.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--Do I need a college degree?--</p>\n<p>You just need to be awesome.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--Are there any geographic restrictions?--</p>\n<p>As long as you are in a country that doesn’t have active sanctions from the US government, we are interested. Our founder isn’t known for respecting the government much, but they have all the guns, so…</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--Do I need an engineering degree?--</p>\n<p>Nope. Our current product engineer is largely self-taught and didn't go to engineering school. We don't care about credentials - we care about whether you can actually invent great products. If you can demonstrate strong CAD skills and a track record of making things, that matters way more than a diploma.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--What CAD software do you use?--</p>\n<p>We currently use SolidWorks, but we're not religious about it. What matters is that you can produce production-ready 3D models. If you're proficient in Fusion 360, AutoCAD, or similar - that's fine. Just know that you'll need to come in with strong 3D modeling skills; we're not training from zero.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--How many products will I work on at once?--</p>\n<p>Typically 1-2 at a time. This is deep focus work, not juggling a dozen things. You'll spend months on a single product, iterating until it's genuinely great.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--What if I've never worked in consumer products before?--</p>\n<p>That's fine, as long as you have demonstrated ability to design and prototype physical products. Whether that came from industrial design, mechanical engineering, or just being a maker who builds stuff in your garage - we care about the skill, not the pedigree.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--Do I need to deal with manufacturers directly?--</p>\n<p>You'll collaborate with our supply chain team on Design for Manufacturing and be involved in sourcing decisions, but you won't own the vendor relationships. Supply chain handles the day-to-day communication with factories. Your job is to design products that can actually be manufactured.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--What does a typical day look like?--</p>\n<p>Variable as hell. Some days you're deep in CAD. Some days you're running prototype tests. Some days you're researching materials or competitor products. Very few meetings. Basically no bureaucracy. What's consistent is working independently, solving hard problems, and pushing toward \"remarkable.\"</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--6-36 months per product? Really?--</p>\n<p>Really. We iterate until it's genuinely great. We'd rather take 2 years to launch something remarkable than rush out something mediocre in 3 months. If that timeline makes you anxious, this probably isn't the role for you.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--What types of products will I be working on?--</p>\n<p>Primarily kitchen and household products. Things that solve real problems people have. We're especially interested in products that can be patented and are hard for competitors to copy. Generally, we want to either radically improve a product in its category (like 200% better) or invent a new category.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--This sounds pretty good, though I’m still skeptical that this isn’t a pyramid scheme.--</p>\n<p>You sound just like the tax authorities!</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>--That doesn’t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--</p>\n<p>Please submit your information on the following page to apply. We promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>There will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>Once you’re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don’t want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you “yes” or “no”, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!</p>\n\n<p><strong>To apply:</strong> <a href=\"https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/jls-trading-co-product-developer-engineer-fun-ecom-co-great-people\">https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/jls-trading-co-product-developer-engineer-fun-ecom-co-great-people</a></p>",

      "descriptionText": "- Do you see crappy products everywhere and think \"I could make that so much better\"?\n\n- Does your brain refuse to stop solving problems, even when you're supposed to be relaxing?\n\n- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?\n\nIf so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don’t put up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.\n\nWe are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.\n\n--Is this a real job ad?--\n\nYup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it’s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 70ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we’re big time, people.\n\nOur careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we’re a pretty big deal):\n\nhttp://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\nAnd check out our reviews on Google, Glassdoor, or Indeed to see that it’s not just the founder’s mother who says we’re cool.\n\n--What do you guys do?--\n\nWe do a lot of different things these days including selling awesome consumer products (these are just a small sampling): \n\n- Bad Parking Cards (https://amz.run/5Eya)\n\n- Beverage Barricades (https://amz.run/6kip)\n\n- Child Chucker (https://amz.run/9EUz)\n\nRunning this Amazon Pay-Per-Click agency: PPCFarm.com (we’re really, really good at PPC)\n\nAnd we will soon be launching a SaaS product for inventory management.\n\nWe are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and it’s our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.\n\n--What is your company like?--\n\n1. You Can Be Yourself. You don’t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged), and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you.\n\n2. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn’t matter what your credentials are – it matters what you get done.\n\n3. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don’t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we’re happy campers.\n\n4. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you’re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you’re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\n\n5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.\n\n6. No Micro-Management. Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren’t the place for you.\n\n7. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could it really be? [Yes]\n\n8. Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful – internal politics are at a minimum here.\n\n9. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.\n\n10. We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\n\n11. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.\n\n12. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. We’ve even started letting people skip meetings during labor!\n\n13. Self-Funded So We Can Do What’s Right for Us. We don’t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.\n\n--What are your company’s values?--\n\nSee here: http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\nYes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it’s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you’ll learn a lot about us.\n\n--OK, so I’ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--\n\nNo.\n\n--Wait... What?--\n\nOK fine. Super short version:\n\nInventing remarkable consumer products - taking concepts from \"this should exist\" to \"holy shit, why didn't this exist before\" - in the kitchen and household space.\n\nBulleted Responsibilities:\n\nTake product concepts and figure out how to make them work elegantly\n\nDesign products in CAD (we use SolidWorks, but we're flexible on software)\n\nPrototype heavily in-house (3D printing, testing, breaking, improving, repeat)\n\nIterate relentlessly until the product hits our \"remarkable\" quality threshold\n\nCollaborate with our supply chain team on Design for Manufacturing and sourcing decisions\n\nDeliver production-ready CAD files and specifications for manufacturing\n\nSolve hard problems that don't have obvious solutions (this is like 80% of the job)\n\nTo give you an idea of what we make: Beverage Barricades (the magnetic drink guard), CrocoDicer, and various kitchen gadgets that make people's lives meaningfully better. We're not making generic private label crap - we're inventing things that are genuinely novel and patentable.\n\nFair warning: this is slow, deliberate work. A single product might take 6-36 months from concept to launch. We are quality-obsessed and refuse to ship mediocre products. If you need the dopamine hit of shipping something every week, you will be miserable here.\n\nLike everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.\n\nIt is challenging, but fun work that’s going to require a lot of time and task management, problem-solving, and a reasonable amount of people skills.\n\n--Do I need a college degree?--\n\nYou just need to be awesome.\n\n--Are there any geographic restrictions?--\n\nAs long as you are in a country that doesn’t have active sanctions from the US government, we are interested. Our founder isn’t known for respecting the government much, but they have all the guns, so…\n\n--Do I need an engineering degree?--\n\nNope. Our current product engineer is largely self-taught and didn't go to engineering school. We don't care about credentials - we care about whether you can actually invent great products. If you can demonstrate strong CAD skills and a track record of making things, that matters way more than a diploma.\n\n--What CAD software do you use?--\n\nWe currently use SolidWorks, but we're not religious about it. What matters is that you can produce production-ready 3D models. If you're proficient in Fusion 360, AutoCAD, or similar - that's fine. Just know that you'll need to come in with strong 3D modeling skills; we're not training from zero.\n\n--How many products will I work on at once?--\n\nTypically 1-2 at a time. This is deep focus work, not juggling a dozen things. You'll spend months on a single product, iterating until it's genuinely great.\n\n--What if I've never worked in consumer products before?--\n\nThat's fine, as long as you have demonstrated ability to design and prototype physical products. Whether that came from industrial design, mechanical engineering, or just being a maker who builds stuff in your garage - we care about the skill, not the pedigree.\n\n--Do I need to deal with manufacturers directly?--\n\nYou'll collaborate with our supply chain team on Design for Manufacturing and be involved in sourcing decisions, but you won't own the vendor relationships. Supply chain handles the day-to-day communication with factories. Your job is to design products that can actually be manufactured.\n\n--What does a typical day look like?--\n\nVariable as hell. Some days you're deep in CAD. Some days you're running prototype tests. Some days you're researching materials or competitor products. Very few meetings. Basically no bureaucracy. What's consistent is working independently, solving hard problems, and pushing toward \"remarkable.\"\n\n--6-36 months per product? Really?--\n\nReally. We iterate until it's genuinely great. We'd rather take 2 years to launch something remarkable than rush out something mediocre in 3 months. If that timeline makes you anxious, this probably isn't the role for you.\n\n--What types of products will I be working on?--\n\nPrimarily kitchen and household products. Things that solve real problems people have. We're especially interested in products that can be patented and are hard for competitors to copy. Generally, we want to either radically improve a product in its category (like 200% better) or invent a new category.\n\n--This sounds pretty good, though I’m still skeptical that this isn’t a pyramid scheme.--\n\nYou sound just like the tax authorities!\n\n--That doesn’t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--\n\nPlease submit your information on the following page to apply. We promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.\n\nThere will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.\n\nOnce you’re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don’t want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you “yes” or “no”, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).\n\nThank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!",

      "descriptionText": "You must be located in the Americas, Europe, or Israel to apply.\n\nA·Team is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. \n\nAfter talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $85+ million since.\n\nAs part of A·Team, you can expect:\n\nHigh-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies sent your way; generally $90-$150+/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, Pepsi, Walmart, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/Insight/Tiger/etc.\n\nWork alongside friends old & new: our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.\n\nFull autonomy: say \"no\" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. \n\nSmall, curated, off-the-record gatherings: for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.\n\nKeep 100% of what you earn: if you charge $120/hr, you get $120/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on top of your rate.\n\nHow to apply:\n\nGo here: https://build.a.team/remotivereferral + mention Remotive. We respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there’s a fit.\n\nWhat you’ll do:\n\nOnce part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests. Find the right pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would\n\nMissions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. \n\nYou’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. \n\nWho A·Team is for:\n\nSenior software developers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.\n\nThose who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role, who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.\n\nThe majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work), bootstrapping a side project, or looking for their next big thing\n\nWho A·Team is not for:\n\nPeople looking for small gigs\n\nFolks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites\n\nThose still early in their careers (<4 years) and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet)\n\nOur long-term vision:\n\nA·Team is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builder. We call them \"unhirables\": people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to, but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small, autonomous, distributed expert teams. \n\nTo help us secure amazing missions, we raised $60 million+  from Insight Partenrs, Tiger Global, NFX, RocNation, along with the former CEO of Upwork, the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade, Apple's Global Head of Recruiting, YC Partner Aaron Harris, Wharton's Adam Grant, and Duke's Dan Ariely.",

When metrics dip, you don't make excuses—you analyze root causes, develop solutions, and drive improvements.\nYou develop your people. Your assistants visibly grow under your leadership—they're more confident, more skilled, and more engaged than when they started.\nYou protect the client experience. Issues are resolved quickly, quality is consistently high, and clients trust your team to deliver.\nYou're proactive, not reactive. You spot trends early, address small issues before they become big problems, and stay ahead of potential risks.\nYou communicate clearly and frequently. Your team always knows where they stand, what's expected, and how they're performing. Clients and leadership are kept informed without needing to chase you for updates.\nYou foster accountability. Your team members take ownership of their work because you've built a culture where performance matters and excellence is recognized.\nYou're a problem-solver, not a problem-identifier. When you bring issues to leadership, you also bring potential solutions and recommendations.\n\nWho This Role is NOT For:\nYou're looking for a \"management\" title without the daily coaching grind. This role is 80% coaching and 20% administration. If you don't genuinely enjoy developing people and giving regular feedback, this isn't the right fit.\nYou need highly structured processes with little ambiguity. While we have SOPs and frameworks, every client and assistant is different. You'll need to adapt your approach, make judgment calls, and navigate grey areas independently.\nYou avoid difficult conversations. Performance management means having tough discussions about underperformance, behavior issues, and sometimes making decisions about fit.\nYou wait to be told what to do. We need coaches who see problems and solve them, who identify opportunities and seize them, who take initiative without being prompted.\nYou're uncomfortable with data and metrics. This role is driven by numbers—CSAT scores, quality audits, productivity rates, and adherence.\nYou prefer to work alone rather than collaborate. You'll be coordinating with CSMs, Success Coaches, Training teams, Technical Support, and more.\nYou need constant validation or hand-holding. We provide support and guidance, but you're expected to work autonomously between weekly check-ins with your manager.\nYou resist feedback or believe you've \"figured it out.\" The best coaches are coachable themselves—open to feedback, willing to try new approaches, and committed to continuous learning.\nYou see this as a stepping stone, not a destination. While there's growth potential, we're looking for someone who genuinely wants to excel at coaching and team leadership, not someone just passing through to their \"real\" goal.\n\nQualified Candidate RequirementsExperience Requirements:\nSupervisory/Team Leadership Experience: Minimum 1 year of direct people management or team leadership experience, with proven ability to coach, develop, and hold team members accountable for performance (remote team management strongly preferred)\nBPO/Outsourcing/Customer Service/Virtual Assistant Background: At least 2 years in customer service, call center operations, BPO, or virtual assistant management roles—you understand the rhythm and challenges of client-facing remote work\nPerformance Management Experience: Demonstrated experience managing KPIs, conducting performance reviews, implementing improvement plans, and driving measurable performance improvements across a team\nAccount Management or Client Services: Experience managing client relationships, addressing escalations, and ensuring client satisfaction in a service delivery environment\nQuality Assurance Background: Familiarity with QA processes, call/ticket monitoring, scoring rubrics, and providing coaching based on quality audits\n\nTechnical Requirements:\nMetrics & Analytics Proficiency: Strong understanding of key performance indicators (CSAT, NPS, AHT, FCR, quality scores, adherence, productivity rates) and ability to analyze data to drive decisions\nCRM & Productivity Tools: Comfortable working with CRM systems (e.g., HubSpot, Salesforce, Zendesk), project management tools (Monday.com, Asana, ClickUp), communication platforms (Slack, Microsoft Teams), and call center technologies\nReporting & Documentation Skills: Ability to create clear performance reports, document coaching sessions, maintain team records, and communicate insights to leadership effectively\nTech Savvy: Quick to learn new software platforms and digital tools; comfortable troubleshooting basic technical issues and guiding team members through system challenges\nAI & Automation Comfortable: Open to leveraging AI tools for performance tracking, quality monitoring, and productivity enhancement (we'll provide training on specific tools)\n\nSkills & Competencies:\nCoaching Excellence: You know how to give feedback that motivates rather than discourages. You tailor your coaching style to individual needs.\nPerformance-Driven Mindset: You're energized by hitting targets and driving continuous improvement.\nCommunication Mastery: You communicate clearly across all channels—written, verbal, and visual. You can simplify complex concepts, deliver difficult messages with empathy, and keep stakeholders informed without overwhelming them.\nEmotional Intelligence: You read people well—understanding motivations, managing emotions (yours and others'), building rapport, and navigating interpersonal dynamics with grace.\nProblem-Solving & Critical Thinking: You don't just react to issues—you diagnose root causes, evaluate options, and implement sustainable solutions.\nHigh Autonomy & Self-Management: You manage your time effectively, prioritize competing demands, and drive results without needing constant oversight.\nAdaptability & Resilience: You thrive in fast-paced environments where priorities shift.\nDetail-Oriented with Big-Picture Awareness: You catch small quality issues before they become big problems, while also understanding how your team's performance fits into broader company goals.\nIntegrity & Accountability: You model the behavior you expect from your team. You own mistakes, follow through on commitments, and operate with honesty and transparency.\nConflict Resolution: You handle interpersonal conflicts professionally, mediate disputes fairly, and create solutions that preserve relationships while addressing the underlying issues.\n\nNice-to-Haves:\nPrevious experience coaching or managing virtual assistants, executive assistants, or remote customer service teams\nBackground in workforce management (scheduling, capacity planning, forecasting)\nExperience with remote work performance tracking tools (Time Doctor, Hubstaff, etc.)\nExperience managing multi-client portfolios or teams supporting diverse industries\nCoaching certifications or formal training in performance management techniques\nExperience scaling teams or building team performance from the ground up\nPrevious startup or high-growth company experience where you wore multiple hats\n\nKey Time Zone & Schedule Requirements:\nWork Schedule: Monday-Friday, 10:00 PM - 7:00 AM Philippine Time (PHT), aligned with US business hours. This is an overnight schedule to support real-time coaching and client escalations during US working hours.\nAvailability: Must be flexible for occasional evening/weekend coverage during critical client needs, team emergencies, or special projects. Advance notice provided when possible.\nReal-Time Presence: This role requires being available during assistant working hours to provide live coaching, handle escalations, and monitor performance in real-time.\nStart Date: Immediate availability preferred; maximum 2-weeks' notice.\n\nEquipment Requirements (Self-Provided):\nComputer/laptop meeting company specifications\nReliable high-speed internet connection (minimum 50 Mbps download/10 Mbps upload)\nProfessional headset for clear communication during training sessions\nQuiet, distraction-free work environment\nBackup power/internet solution for uninterrupted training delivery\n\nTraits of a Top Performer in This Role:\nPlayer-Coach Mentality: You're not above the work. You'll roll up your sleeves to help your team when they're overwhelmed, model the behavior you expect, and lead by example.\nHigh Standards, High Empathy: You expect excellence from your team, but you balance high standards with genuine care for their growth and well-being.\nBias Toward Action: When you see a problem, you act. You don't wait for perfect information or permission.\nGrowth Mindset: You believe people can improve with the right coaching and support.\nCalm Under Pressure: When crises hit (and they will), you stay composed.\nData-Informed, Not Data-Paralyzed: You let metrics guide your decisions, but you don't lose sight of the humans behind the numbers.\nResourceful & Scrappy: You find solutions with the resources available.\nFeedback-Hungry: You actively seek input from your manager, peers, clients, and team members.\nOwnership Mindset: Your team's wins are your wins; their struggles are yours to solve.\nLong-Term Thinking: You're not just putting out today's fires—you're building systems and developing people that create sustainable, long-term performance improvements.\n\nWhy Join Magic as an Operations Team Lead (Success Coach)Compensation & Growth:\nCompetitive Rate: $5.00 USD/hour as an independent contractor\nPerformance-Based Growth: Proven high performers have clear pathways to Senior Success Coach, Operations Manager, or specialized coaching roles (Quality, Training, Workforce Management)\nMeaningful Impact: Your work directly influences assistant career trajectories and client business success—you'll see the tangible results of your coaching daily\nOwnership & Influence: As a coach managing your own team, you have real autonomy to shape team culture, implement improvements, and drive results your way\n\nWork Environment:\n100% Remote: Work from anywhere with reliable internet—no commute, no office politics\nHigh Autonomy: Weekly check-ins with your manager, but day-to-day, you're empowered to lead your team as you see fit\nCollaborative Culture: Join a team of fellow coaches who share best practices, support each other, and celebrate wins together\nAI-Powered Tools: Access cutting-edge AI and automation tools that make coaching more effective and give you insights you can act on\nSupportive Leadership: Work with Customer Success Managers who care about your success and provide mentorship, resources, and growth opportunities\nFast-Growing Company: Magic has grown 10x and is scaling rapidly—your career can grow with us.\n\nOriginally posted on Himalayas",

      "descriptionText": "About the Water Foundation The Water Foundation is a nonprofit philanthropy working to support lasting water solutions for communities, economies, and the environment. The Foundation complements strategic grantmaking with creative field-building and engagement with high-level decision makers and community leaders and helps funders identify and act on opportunities to better manage water. \n\nThe Water Foundation works in key watersheds across the West, as well as on federal policy, recognizing that water crosses political boundaries and natural places face similar challenges across the country. As a singularly focused water funder, the Water Foundation serves the entire water field, deploying staff expertise to move resources to the groups that can most effectively improve water systems that affect people and nature. The Water Foundation’s partners span a broad spectrum: conservation organizations, environmental justice groups, agricultural associations, water providers, business groups, and local, tribal, state, and federal agencies. \n\nIn 2024, the Water Foundation launched our ambitious strategic framework to guide the efforts and impact of the organization in the coming years. This strategy, which reflects extensive field input from partners and stakeholders, identifies the Foundation’s approach to catalyzing and advancing lasting water solutions at the local, state, and federal levels. The Foundation prioritizes securing safe, equitable, clean, and accessible water for people, restoring and sustaining freshwater ecosystems, and building climate resilient communities and watersheds. These three goals are critical to the future of water. In pursuing these goals, the Foundation supports the field in tackling immediate water problems, including polluted drinking water and collapsing ecosystems, in ways that alter system drivers, such as social inequality and outmoded infrastructure. We also work to mobilize new resources for water by convening the philanthropic community. In 2022, we expanded such efforts when the Water Table funder collaborative joined forces with the Foundation. This integration offers the opportunity to channel additional resources toward sustainable and equitable water solutions. \n\nInequity and injustice underlie many of the challenges the Water Foundation is working to address, such as the failure to provide clean, safe, and affordable drinking water or access to free-flowing rivers and green space to all communities. The Water Foundation has engaged in a learning initiative to ensure that the principles of diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice are embedded and embodied in their individual behavior, institutional operations, and strategic programming. There is a deep commitment to ongoing growth and learning in this area. The Water Foundation’s work is driven by the following organizational values:\n\nCollaboration: Strategize, act, and learn in partnership with colleagues internally and externally to advance our collective goals. Deepen connections across and between water sector networks and related issues like climate, health, nature, food, and equity. \nHumility: Recognize and center the knowledge, experiences, and leadership of our partners and the communities we serve, while honoring the power of nature. Listen to and learn from our partners and nature, so that we support a community-led and nature-based vision for a resilient water future. \nSustainability: Advance resilient, intergenerational solutions that sustain the environment and those who depend upon it while honoring the intrinsic value of nature and strengthening organizations and communities that seek an equitable, alternative vision for the future.\nTransformation: Shape our strategies, work, and practices for systemic change towards a collaborative, just, and sustainable water future in the US. \nJustice: Align our policies, practices, and resources so that all people and ecosystems have genuine opportunities to thrive. \nMore information about the Water Foundation can be found at www.waterfdn.org.\n\nIn 2025, the Water Foundation launched an affiliated 501(c)(4), the Water Action Fund (www.wateractionfund.org) with a mission to ensure access to essential water resources for people and nature by supporting the advancement of local, state, and federal policies that promote public well-being and help U.S. communities prepare for various crises, including natural disasters and other emergencies.\n\nThe OpportunityThe Water Foundation seeks a Grants and Contracts Manager (Manager) to ensure the effective operations, compliance, and administrative aspects of the Water Foundation’s and Water Action Fund’s outgoing grants and contracts.
