1. Copy this entire file
2. Navigate to your folder structure: src/data/posts/[author-id]/[year]/[month]/
   - Find your author ID in src/config/authors.ts (author1, author2, etc.)
   - Use the year and month from your "date" field above

   - Example: src/data/posts/author1/2025/01/

3. Paste this file in your folder and rename it:
   - Start with "draft-" to keep it private: draft-your-post-title.md
   - Example: src/data/posts/author1/2025/01/draft-my-awesome-post.md

4. Update the frontmatter above:
   - Change the title, excerpt, tags, author, date, readTime, and slug
   - Make sure the year/month in your folder path matches your date field
   - Use your author ID (author1, author2) in the author field

5. Write your content below, then test locally with: npm run dev

6. When ready to publish, rename the file to remove "draft-"

# Your Blog Post Title Here

Start writing your blog post content here using Markdown formatting.

## Section Headings

Use `##` for main sections and `###` for subsections.

### Subsection Example

You can write regular paragraphs, and they'll be automatically formatted.

**Bold text** and *italic text* work as expected.

## Lists and Other Formatting

- Use bullet points like this
- For unordered lists
- Multiple items work great

1. Numbered lists also work
2. Just use numbers with periods
3. They'll be formatted automatically

## Code Examples

You can include inline `code snippets` or full code blocks:

```javascript
// Code blocks support syntax highlighting
function example() {
  return "This will be nicely formatted";
}
```

## Blockquotes

> Use blockquotes for important callouts, quotes, or highlighted information.
> They'll be styled nicely on the website.

## Links and More

You can add [links like this](https://example.com) and they'll work perfectly.

Remember to:
Keep your content engaging and valuable
Use clear headings to structure your thoughts
Include practical examples when possible
End with a thought-provoking question or call to action
