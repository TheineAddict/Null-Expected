## A pivot year, but not the kind people think

2025 didn’t feel like a career change. It felt like a **lens change**.

I didn’t wake up one morning and decide I’m “done with QA.” I’m still made of QA—skepticism, curiosity, the reflex to trace outcomes back to assumptions. What shifted was the *shape* of the work: from “I find what breaks” to **“I design how we ship without breaking the organisation.”**

Being a tester trained me to see defects. Being a release manager trained me to see **decisions**—and the hidden cost of getting them wrong.

If my earlier identity was *bug hunter*, my 2025 identity became *path designer*: building routes to production that are fast when they can be, deliberate when they must be, and honest about the trade-offs either way.

## Lesson 1: Quality became more about decisions than defects

In QA, a good day often ends with evidence: a repro, a log, a crisp defect description. The feedback loop is tangible.

In release management, the “defect” is often a future tense sentence:

• *If we ship this now, what might we be normalising?*
• *If we delay, what risk are we silently accepting instead?*
• *Who pays for either choice—and do they even know they’re paying?*

My work became less about proving something is broken and more about **making uncertainty legible**.

I started to value different artifacts than I did as a tester:
• risk narratives instead of test scripts,
• decision logs instead of defect lists,
• mitigations and guardrails instead of heroic last-minute testing.

The more I leaned into that, the more I realised something mildly uncomfortable: sometimes the most “quality-positive” thing you can do is *not* block a release, but ship it with explicit constraints, monitoring, rollback readiness, and a clear understanding of blast radius.

That’s not lowering standards. That’s **treating quality as a system property**, not a personal virtue.

## Lesson 2: “Not yet” is a strategy. “No” is just a reflex.

As a tester, “no” can feel righteous. It’s clean. It’s safe. It’s also occasionally lazy—because it stops the conversation at the exact moment it should become more precise.

Release work forced me to develop a more disciplined language:

• **“Not yet, because…”** (with the because grounded in risk, not preference)
• **“Yes, if…”** (with explicit conditions and mitigations)
• **“Yes, but…”** (with transparency about what we’re trading)
• **“No, unless you’re willing to own…”** (with ownership clearly named)

This sounds semantic, but it changed my relationships across the org. It moved me from gatekeeper posture to **partnership posture**, while still holding a hard line on reality.

I stopped trying to win arguments and started trying to win clarity.

## Lesson 3: ITIL isn’t the enemy. It just speaks a different dialect.

I used to see governance as the thing that happens *to* delivery.

In 2025, I saw governance as something you can **design**—either well or badly.

ITIL concepts (change enablement, incident/problem thinking, controlled risk acceptance) can be profoundly compatible with Agile delivery. The friction usually comes from one of two failures:

1. **Governance that’s theatre** (forms over outcomes, “approval” as superstition).
2. **Agility that’s vibes** (speed fetishism, accountability avoidance dressed as “empowerment”).

My job became translation:
• translating technical complexity into business risk,
• translating “process” into purpose,
• translating “move fast” into “move safely at the speed the system can sustain.”

When governance works, it’s not a brake. It’s a set of **guardrails** that make higher speed sustainable.

When it doesn’t, it becomes a museum exhibit: a beautiful structure built to preserve the past.

## Lesson 4: CAB is where power dynamics show up (and where quality becomes political)

![Minimal decision desk scene illustrating quality as decision-making in release management](/null-expected-decision-desk-release-management-quality.jpg)

CAB taught me something QA rarely teaches cleanly: quality doesn’t just live in code. It lives in **permission**.

In a CAB conversation, you can watch:
• whose risk is treated as real and whose is treated as “noise,”
• whose “urgent” is taken seriously,
• who gets away with ambiguity,
• who gets asked for proof, twice.

It’s easy to become cynical there. I flirted with cynicism.

But the better move—harder, more useful—was learning how to operate ethically inside those dynamics:
• calling out fuzzy risk language without humiliating anyone,
• refusing to let confidence replace evidence,
• protecting the team from performative panic,
• and, when needed, being the person who says: *we’re not gambling with production today.*

CAB made me understand that quality work includes **social engineering**, not in the manipulative sense—more in the “systems include humans” sense.

## Lesson 5: Visibility is not vanity. It’s part of the job.

There’s a romantic story testers sometimes inherit: be invisible, be humble, do the right thing quietly.

The problem is that invisible work is easy to undervalue—and easy to overload.

In release management, invisibility is actively dangerous:
• if nobody sees the decision-making, they assume it’s automatic,
• if nobody sees the coordination, they assume it’s effortless,
• if nobody sees the emotional labour, they assume it doesn’t exist.

I learned to make work visible without making it performative:
• crisp comms,
• documented decisions,
• explicit risk framing,
• predictable cadences.

This wasn’t about ego. It was about **creating organisational memory**, and protecting myself from becoming a single point of silent failure.

## Lesson 6: The emotional load is real—and pretending otherwise makes you brittle

Owning releases changes how you feel time.

A tester can end the day with “I found three critical issues.” A release manager ends the day with “I prevented three futures,” and none of them are tangible. You don’t get the satisfying closure of a bug being fixed. You get the weird quiet of a disaster that didn’t happen.

That’s a recipe for burnout if you don’t name it.

The emotional load isn’t only stress. It’s also:
• holding competing incentives without becoming cynical,
• being the person people call when things are on fire,
• absorbing uncertainty so other people can keep building.

In 2025, I started treating that load like a real operational concern:
• boundaries,
• sustainable cadence,
• and—most importantly—refusing the hero narrative.

No more “it’s fine, I’ll just handle it.”  
That sentence is how organisations accidentally create their next outage *and* their next resignation.

## Lesson 7: Starting Null Expected changed how I see my career

Null Expected began as a personal itch: I wanted a place where QA could be discussed without the usual caricatures—without pretending quality is either a magical mindset or a checkbox at the end of a sprint.

But once I started writing, I noticed something: writing forces intellectual honesty.

It’s easy to have opinions in your head. It’s harder to defend them in public with structure, nuance, and consequences.

Null Expected became my way of doing three things at once:
1. **consolidating my own thinking** (turning instinct into explicit heuristics),
2. **making the invisible work visible** (for others, and for future me),
3. **reclaiming narrative ownership** of my career.

Not “I used to be a tester and now I’m something better.”
More like: “I’m building a coherent body of work around how quality actually happens in modern delivery.”

That shift made me braver—in conversations, in decisions, and in how I advocate for the role of QA and release leadership.

## What I’m leaning into in 2026

I don’t want 2026 to be a year of vague ambition. I want it to be a year of deliberate direction.

Here’s what I’m choosing on purpose:

• **More thought leadership with teeth**: fewer platitudes, more real constraints, more honest trade-offs.
• **Stronger release governance as a product**: not bureaucracy—designing systems that scale across teams without killing flow.
• **Conference talks and public writing**: not to “build a brand,” but to sharpen arguments and contribute to the craft.
• **Less lone-wolf quality**: building shared ownership, clearer guardrails, and fewer heroic interventions.
• **Better sustainability**: shipping outcomes without sacrificing nervous-system health.

If 2025 taught me anything, it’s that quality isn’t a department and it isn’t a personality trait.

Quality is the discipline of making risk visible, decisions explicit, and outcomes sustainable—over time, with humans in the loop.

And for the first time in a long time, that feels like a career I’m not just doing.

It feels like one I’m **authoring**.
