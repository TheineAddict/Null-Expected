# First Post

This is a test post to verify that the blog system is working correctly.

## Testing the System

I'm creating this post to ensure that:

- New posts are picked up automatically
- The frontmatter parsing works correctly
- The post appears in the correct categories
- Featured posts show up on the homepage

## Content Test

This post should appear in:
- The main blog listing
- The "QA Processes" category
- The "Featured Insights" section on the homepage

Let's see if this works!

*Testing complete - hopefully this post is now visible!*
